# and updates entries -- it never removes ones whose source file is gone.
# That silently left two deleted ZScript files sitting in RS_Main.zip the
# night this repo was split out, which is exactly the shape of bug that
# becomes a fatal duplicate-class crash the moment two pk3s both carry a copy
# of the same class. Delete-then-rebuild is the only version of this script
# that can't reintroduce that.

# EXCLUSIONS EXTENDED 2026-08-26. The shipped RS_HardPoints.zip was carrying
# README.md. A lump name IGNORES ITS EXTENSION, so anything left in the tree
# can shadow a real lump -- a stray MODELDEF.bak in a pk3 root has silently
# replaced the real MODELDEF before.
#
# STRUCTURAL NOTE: this is an EXCLUSION list, so it can only ever exclude what
# somebody thought of. The durable fix is an explicit INCLUDE list naming what
# belongs in the pk3 -- see E:\mERGE\RS_VR_Unified\build.ps1. Left as
# exclusions here because a wrong include list silently drops content and
# breaks the mod, which is worse than shipping a stray text file.
